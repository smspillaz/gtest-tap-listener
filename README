Overview
--------

This is a small contribution to Google Test. Oliver and I were working on an 
issue in Jenkins plug-in when he told me about Google Test. As this plug-in 
relies heavily on TAP, we talked about how it looked like a good idea have TAP 
in GoogleTest.

Although GoogleTest has a XML outputter, it lacks a TAP one. Using its Event 
Listeners model it was quite easy to implement this first version of this TAP 
listener.

See the samples directory for code to be used as reference. Feel free to send 
contributions, pull requests, suggestions or any other feedback to the project.

This fork
---------

This fork aims for compatibility with the tap-mocha-reporter module from
node, which allows the use of all the mocha reporters in a test.
